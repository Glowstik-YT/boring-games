    <h2 style="margin-left: 3%; font-size: 30px;">How did we make the website</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5%;  font-size: 22px;">We orignaly met at a virtul hackathon in September, 2020. A couple months later we thought of making a website for fun during the boring days at home in the U.S. We all knew how to code a website and a couple of games, so we did! This website is made with Html, Css and a bit of Javascript, but the games are made in a lot of different languges from c# to js to HTML5!</p>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 3%; font-size: 30px;">Why we made the website</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5%;  font-size: 22px;">We really liked coding, and met at a hackathon. It also happened to be 2020 :( at the time, so we were bored of sitting at home during quarintine. We were also able to code and we were also able to code at a intermidiate level, so it would not be like starting from the beginning without knowing any basics or anything. </p>
